>>> odoo_client = OdooClient(
...     hostname="localhost",
...     port=8069,
...     protocol="jsonrpc",
...     database="odoodb",
...     user="test-user",
...     password="<password>",
... )
>>> odoo_client.account_move_lines.get(1234)
AccountMoveLine(record={'id': 1234, ...}, fields=None)
```
