## Manager

The partner manager is available as the `partners`
attribute on the Odoo client object.

```python
>>> from openstack_odooclient import Client as OdooClient
>>> odoo_client = OdooClient(
...     hostname="localhost",
...     port=8069,
...     protocol="jsonrpc",
...     database="odoodb",
...     user="test-user",
...     password="<password>",
... )
>>> odoo_client.partners.get(1234)
Partner(record={'id': 1234, ...}, fields=None)
```

For more information on how to use managers, refer to [Managers](index.md).
