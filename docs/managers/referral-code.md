# Referral Codes

This page documents how to use the manager and record objects
for referral codes.

## Manager

The project manager is available as the `referral_codes`
attribute on the Odoo client object.

```python
>>> from openstack_odooclient import Client as OdooClient
>>> odoo_client = OdooClient(
...     hostname="localhost",
...     port=8069,
...     protocol="jsonrpc",
...     database="odoodb",
...     user="test-user",
...     password="<password>",
... )
>>> odoo_client.referral_codes.get(1234)
ReferralCode(record={'id': 1234, ...}, fields=None)
```

For more information on how to use managers, refer to [Managers](index.md).

## Record

The referral code manager returns `ReferralCode` record objects.

To import the record class for type hinting purposes:

```python
from openstack_odooclient import ReferralCode
```

The record class currently implements the following fields and methods.

### `allowed_uses`

```python
allowed_uses: int
```

The number of allowed uses of this referral code.

Set to `-1` for unlimited uses.

### `before_reward_usage_threshold`

```python
before_reward_usage_threshold: float
```

The amount of usage that must be recorded by the new sign-up
before the reward credit is awarded to the referrer.

### `code`

```python
code: str
```

The unique referral code.

### `name`

```python
name: str
```

### `referral_ids`
