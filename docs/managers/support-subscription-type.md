## Manager

The support subscription type manager is available as the `support_subscription_types`
attribute on the Odoo client object.

```python
>>> from openstack_odooclient import Client as OdooClient
>>> odoo_client = OdooClient(
...     hostname="localhost",
...     port=8069,
...     protocol="jsonrpc",
...     database="odoodb",
...     user="test-user",
...     password="<password>",
... )
>>> odoo_client.support_subscription_types.get(1234)
SupportSubscriptionType(record={'id': 1234, ...}, fields=None)
```

For more information on how to use managers, refer to [Managers](index.md).

## Record

The support subscription type manager returns `SupportSubscriptionType` record objects.

To import the record class for type hinting purposes:

```python
from openstack_odooclient import SupportSubscriptionType
```

The record class currently implements the following fields and methods.

### `billing_type`

```python
billing_type: Literal["paid", "complimentary"]
```

The type of support subscription.

Values:

* ``paid`` - Charge the subscription independently
* ``complimentary`` - Bundled with a contract that includes the charge

### `name`

```

the support subscription.

```

The name of the [product](product.md) to use to invoice
the support subscription.


### `product`

This fetches the full record from Odoo once,
and caches it for subsequent accesses.

```
