## Manager

The voucher code manager is available as the `voucher_codes`
attribute on the Odoo client object.

```python
>>> from openstack_odooclient import Client as OdooClient
>>> odoo_client = OdooClient(
...     hostname="localhost",
...     port=8069,
...     protocol="jsonrpc",
...     database="odoodb",
...     user="test-user",
...     password="<password>",
... )
>>> odoo_client.voucher_codes.get(1234)
VoucherCode(record={'id': 1234, ...}, fields=None)
```

For more information on how to use managers, refer to [Managers](index.md).

## Record

The voucher code manager returns `VoucherCode` record objects.

```

Whether or not this voucher code has been claimed.
